### Summery
This years code contains many improvements relative to the 2023 robot code. This is our second year competing with swerve drive, and the code's primary improvements reflect this. The overall results have been smoother and more reliable swerve drive, plus the added benefit of more organized code.

### Y.A.G.S.L.
This year, Yet Another Generic Swerve Library (YAGSL) has replaced last year's custom swerve code. Although the custom code *did* work, it contained several inconsistancies in units, causing difficulty in understanding the code, and failed to address certain issues that made it very difficult to drive. In addition to this, we had no PathPlanner or trajectory support, so autos were very basic.

This year, YAGSL has transformed both our driving experience and our autonomous ability, not to mention making the code much easier to understand.

### Learning
Throughout the off-season and into this year, our software subteam (currently one student) has learned much of PID control algorithims, encoders, vision processing, best code practices, and how to apply these things. This helps programming to go much faster and ultimately allows our currently reletively small team to do more within the build season.
